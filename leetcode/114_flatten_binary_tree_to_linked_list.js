// You are given two arrays of positive integers, boxes and warehouse, representing the heights of some boxes of unit width and the heights of n rooms in a warehouse respectively. The warehouse's rooms are labelled from 0 to n - 1 from left to right where warehouse[i] (0-indexed) is the height of the ith room.
//
// Boxes are put into the warehouse by the following rules:
//
// Boxes cannot be stacked.
// You can rearrange the insertion order of the boxes.
// Boxes can only be pushed into the warehouse from left to right only.
// If the height of some room in the warehouse is less than the height of a box, then that box and all other boxes behind it will be stopped before that room.
// Return the maximum number of boxes you can put into the warehouse.
//
//
//
// Example 1:
//
//
// Input: boxes = [4,3,4,1], warehouse = [5,3,3,4,1]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
//
// We can first put the box of height 1 in room 4. Then we can put the box of height 3 in either of the 3 rooms 1, 2, or 3. Lastly, we can put one box of height 4 in room 0.
// There is no way we can fit all 4 boxes in the warehouse.
// Example 2:
//
//
// Input: boxes = [1,2,2,3,4], warehouse = [3,4,1,2]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
//
// Notice that it's not possible to put the box of height 4 into the warehouse since it cannot pass the first room of height 3.
// Also, for the last two rooms, 2 and 3, only boxes of height 1 can fit.
// We can fit 3 boxes maximum as shown above. The yellow box can also be put in room 2 instead.
// Swapping the orange and green boxes is also valid, or swapping one of them with the red box.
// Example 3:
//
// Input: boxes = [1,2,3], warehouse = [1,2,3,4]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: Since the first room in the warehouse is of height 1, we can only put boxes of height 1.
// Example 4:
//
// Input: boxes = [4,5,6], warehouse = [3,3,3,3,3]
// Output: 0
//
//
// Constraints:
//
// n == warehouse.length
// 1 <= boxes.length, warehouse.length <= 10^5
// 1 <= boxes[i], warehouse[i] <= 10^9

// intuition is to try each box from descending order and if it fits into the room
// such that the biggest boxes will fit into the warehouse first, with the smaller boxes being fit in last
